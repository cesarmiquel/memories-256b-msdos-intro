memories, 256b intro
by HellMood / DESIRE

Run with DOSBOX 0.74-3 and custom dosbox-0.74-3.conf!
Intro has SOUND, please play it LOUD!

should look and sound like this:

Effects:
1) board of chessboards
2) circles, zooming
3) tilted plane, scrolling
4) parallax checkerboards
5) sierpinski rotozoomer
6) raycast bent tunnel
7) ocean day night simulation
8) fading transitions inbetween
9) midi vibraphone soundscape

ATTENTION!
PLEASE DON'T quit the intro with ESC! :(
although this is possible due to the rules
the intro ends ON ITS OWN with a sky blue screen
Once it ends, you can "CTRL + F9" or type "exit"
to quit the DOSBOX.
